# CS-courses

## Codes and notes from CS classes.

- [x] I'm working towards a CS degree while working as a full-time software developer to really work on CS fundamentals and improve my understanding in this field.
- [x] I have decided to take notes for classes I take each semester.
- [x] I'll be making notes on topics which are most relevant for me - many things I already know may be skipped!
- [x] In other words, these notes may **NOT** be sufficient for your own classes/study.
