# CS-courses

## Codes and summary notes from lectures.

- [x] I'm working towards a degree in `Computer Engineering`, focusing more on Computer Science lectures and taking some engineering/hardware-focused lectures.
- [x] Fun fact - this will be my 3rd bachelor's degree along with `Economics` and `Political Science` upon completion.
- [x] For previous degrees I once enrolled but did not complete include: `Law`/`Commerce`/`Life Science & Technology`.
- [x] While working as a full-time software developer, my goal is to strengthen my knowledge of CS fundamentals and a general understanding of this field.
- [x] From this year, I have decided to take notes for the lectures I take each semester.
- [x] I'll be making notes on the most relevant topics for me - many things I already know may be skipped!
- [x] In other words, these notes may **NOT** be sufficient for your own classes/study.
