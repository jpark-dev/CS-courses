# Software and Engineering

## Software Engineering
- Create/running a software
- modify/scrap depending on the need
- Varying definitions
---
### What is a good software?
A software can be easily understood, used and is compatible with other systems.

- Maintainability for modification/updates
- Reliable
- Efficient - no wasting of system resource
- Acceptability - user-friendly
---
### Software Crisis
- The speed of hardware technology improvement > software development speed
- Can't meet the vast market demand
- Hard to maintain software developed in pre-existing technology
- Lack of understanding in Software
- Heavy focus on development but less in maintenance
- A software engineer needs a logical/procedural approach
- solve problems and lift limitation -> adequate tool/technolgy is required = Need of Software Engineering
- Increase in cost(inflation + salary)
- Projects often faces: over-budget/low-quality/delayed due date/low productivity
- Platform/envrionment barriers
- Technology to develop even faster
- Developing a reliable software
---
### System Engineering
- Analysis/planning/verification/installation/maintenance of a system
- Anything that is related to the system service and limitation of how a system is used/operated/created
- Computer-based system inclduing hardware/software/process engineering
- Software engineering is a part of a process that handles database, application, infrastructure, control, etc.
- Software engineering is accepted as a broader term in these days, and are almost identical in terms of handling a business data system

### Different parts of System Engineering
- Development of sub systems
  - hardware/sofwtare/communcation at the same time
  - sub systems are created and integrated to the whole system
  - commercial systems may be purchased
  - communication between teams is the key

- System Integration
  - Integrating hardware/software/human resource into one system
  - A gradual process to integrate a sub-system at a time
  - Conflicts between sub-systems are often found

- System installation
  - Physical installation must be assessed (cabling/spaces)
  - Training of operators required
  - Two or more systems can co-exist
  - Different environment
  - Resistance to the new system

- System improvement/maintenance
  - Huge systems with long life-cycles must be open to updates and modification
  - cost is the problem
  - difficult to completely change the existing system
  - Legacy system must be analyzed and considered
    - Some processes may be required to run in the legacy system

- Scraping a system
  - End of use
  - Safely remove environment threatning materials
  - Can be reconfigured or transformed to be used in another system

---
## Critical System
- A system with huge impact from business side
- Must be the first priority in all system related logic
- Can cause loss in economic/revenue/human life
- Dependability is the most important feature
  - With no dependability, critical systesm can fail at a higher chance
  - High repair cost
  - Need someone to watch/control/repair unexpected situations
---
### System failures
- Hardware
  - Error in spec
  - Error in parts
  - Lifespan of hardware
- Software
  - Error from planning/analysis/development
- Management

### Types of critical systems
- Safety
  - Can be life-threatening or impact the environment
  - i.e.) insulin supply system or toxic material processing factory

- Mission
  - Can lead to a failure to an important mission
  - i.e.) satellite flies away or missile defense system

- Business
  - Can lead to a failure to business process
  - Can cause huge economic loss
  - i.e.) Banking auto-payment system or stock trading

- Security
  - A Cross concern of all cases
  - Threat to Safety/mission/business process
---
## System Dependability
- the most important feature in important system
- How much users can trust the system
- Operates as expected
- Does not fail normally
- Availability and dependability are different (Can be used but may not be dependable)

### For a Dependability System...
- Availability
  - Possibility of a requested service can be performed at any given time
  - Real operation time / total time
  - Excludes maintenance or failure
  - Fault-tolerant for 24/7 system
  - 2 or more systems and 1 can act as a backup in case of system failure of one
  - i.e) banking system/game server
- Reliability
  - Possibility of system operating without failure during a specific period
  - Frequent failure -> not reliable
  - Result from a software is not reliable
  - i.e.) server crash or wrongly charged tax
- Safety
  - The system should not be hugely damaged when in operation of failure
  - trivial problems causing the whole system failure
  - i.e.) db violation error stopping the entire banking app
- Security
  - Protection against external attack or security breach
  - Priority before other three aspects
  - Absolute basic standard to be met
  - i.e.) an employee logs in to change his/her own salary
